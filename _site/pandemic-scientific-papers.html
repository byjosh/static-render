The point is if you read the papers in this section overall - rather than just this - there are a number of post rollout vaccination studies that agree on the positive effects of the vaccine. So I do not think a balanced reading sees this as negating the value of vaccines - but rather emphasises a better regulatory regime to raise some standards.</p><h3 id="masking-papers">Masking papers</h3><p><a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/149/6/e2022056687/185379/School-Masking-Policies-and-Secondary-SARS-CoV-2">School Masking Policies and Secondary SARS-CoV-2 Transmission</a></p><p><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0272834">A simple surgical mask modification to pass N95 respirator-equivalent fit testing standards during the COVID-19 pandemic | PLOS ONE</a></p><p><a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6625">Masks and Face Coverings for the Lay Public: A Narrative Update: Annals of Internal Medicine: Vol 174, No 4</a></p><p><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2795150">Risk of SARS-CoV-2 Acquisition in Health Care Workers According to Cumulative Patient Exposure and Preferred Mask Type | Infectious Diseases | JAMA Network Open | JAMA Network</a></p><p><a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abi9069">Impact of community masking on COVID-19: A cluster-randomized trial in Bangladesh | Science</a></p><p><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/71131">Efficacy of FFP3 respirators for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthcare workers | eLife</a></p><p><a href="http://ijomeh.eu/Sources-of-healthcare-workers-COVID-19-infections-and-related-safety-guidelines,132898,0,2.html">Sources of healthcare workers’ COVID‑19 infections and related safety guidelines</a></p><p><a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2110117118">An upper bound on one-to-one exposure to infectious human respiratory particles | PNAS</a></p><p><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2774266">Evaluation of Cloth Masks and Modified Procedure Masks as Personal Protective Equipment for the Public During the COVID-19 Pandemic | Public Health | JAMA Internal Medicine | JAMA Network</a></p><h3 id="overall-impact-of-pandemic">Overall impact of pandemic</h3><p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-83040-3">Years of life lost to COVID-19 in 81 countries | Scientific Reports</a></p><p><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)02796-3/fulltext">Estimating excess mortality due to the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic analysis of COVID-19-related mortality, 2020–21 - The Lancet</a></p><p><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2775740">Assessment of Suicide in Japan During the COVID-19 Pandemic vs Previous Years | Psychiatry and Behavioral Health | JAMA Network Open | JAMA Network</a></p><p><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/9/5479/htm#">Joint Effects of Socioeconomic Position, Race/Ethnicity, and Gender on COVID-19 Mortality among Working-Age Adults in the United States</a></p><h3 id="misinfo">Misinfo</h3><p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44159-021-00006-y">The psychological drivers of misinformation belief and its resistance to correction | Nature Reviews Psychology</a></p><p>This: <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/9/7/693/htm">Vaccines | Free Full-Text | The Safety of COVID-19 Vaccinations—We Should Rethink the Policy</a> is a retracted paper that prompted this “<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.373.6551.147">Journal retracts paper claiming COVID-19 vaccines kill | Science</a>” coverage - here is the data source <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210531183355/https://www.lareb.nl/pages/update-van-bijwerkingen">as archived on the Wayback Machine</a> and if you translate “Overlijden ná vaccinatie betekent niet dat een bijwerking van het vaccin de oorzaak is van het overlijden.” which you will find clearly - right above the figures misused by that paper - then you can verify trivially for yourself that the paper is untrustworthy.</p></main><footer> <small><a href="https://github.com/byjosh/jekyll-netlify-boilerplate-accessible-menu">This is a fork</a> (of <a href="https://github.com/danurbanowicz/jekyll-netlify-boilerplate" rel="noopener">Jekyll Netlify Boilerplate</a> that is maintained by <a href="https://www.danurbanowicz.com" rel="noopener">Dan Urbanowicz</a>).</small></footer><script> document.body.style.setProperty('--scroll', "0rem"); document.body.classList.add("with-js"); window.addEventListener('scroll', () => { var scrollamount = (window.pageYOffset / (window.innerHeight * 0.1)); var scroll = "0rem"; if (scrollamount > 0 && scrollamount < 1) { scroll = (scrollamount) + "rem"; } if (scrollamount > 1) { scroll = "1rem"; } document.body.style.setProperty('--scroll', scroll); }, false); </script></body></html>
