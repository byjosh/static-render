(article is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY license</a>).</p><p>The difference across gender for the same socioeconomic position (SEP) and race is the lowest. Then across race for the same gender and socioeconomic position. And then the biggest difference is across socioeconomic position for the same gender and race. But all these layer together so there a 27 fold disparity between the rate in white women of high socioeconomic position versus low socioeconomic position Hispanic men.</p><p><img src="/assets/img/uploads/fig3_doi.org_10.3390_ijerph19095479.png" alt="Bar chart of age-adjusted mortality per 100 thousand population split by gender, race (Hispanic, Black and white), and socioeconomic position (SEP) as a 3 level high, intermediate, low category" /></p><h2 id="it-is-not-just-job-categories">It is not just job categories</h2><p>Figure 3 is horrific enough in itself but what makes it even more striking is Figure 4 from the same article when the two are read together. A later figure in the paper shows a clear and expected correlation with job type. But Figure 4 has low and intermediate socioeconomic white men as having a very similar profile of jobs compared to non-white men - yet the lowest ratio is 47.9 deaths per 100k (low SEP white men) to 127.1 deaths per 100k (low SEP Black men). The job mix looks almost equal - but people are enduring separate and very unequal conditions clearly.</p><p><img src="/assets/img/uploads/fig4_doi.org_10.3390_ijerph19095479.png" alt="Intermediate SEP white men has 37.6% white collar jobs (feasibly remote) and 40.9% blue collar jobs (never remote) - for non-white men 32.9% white collar, 40.1% blue collar (lowest ratio of mortality rate for this SEP and gender is 22.6 to 78.4 - a ratio of 3.46 given a few percentage points difference in the job mix). Low SEP white men 23% white collar, 58.9% blue collar - non-white men with low SEP: 13.6% white collar, 60.9% blue collar." /></p><h2 id="beyond-the-job---racial-wealth-gap">Beyond the job - racial wealth gap</h2><p>The racial wealth gap, as illustrated by <a href="https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/one-time-pubs/color-of-wealth.aspx#collapse2">The Color of Wealth report</a> (source of the <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/12/11/that-was-typo-the-median-net-worth-black-bostonians-really/ze5kxC1jJelx24M3pugFFN/story.html">$8 net worth for Black Bostonians reported here in the Boston Globe</a> while white household net worth was near a quarter of a million dollars), seems an obvious part of the issue (affecting ability to quit to find another job, take time off sick and other relevant factors besides the racism of coworkers and employers).</p><h2 id="lens-to-view-a-protest-through">Lens to view a protest through</h2><p>As well as those graphs leading to the racial wealth gap as an obviously relevant consideration the graphs also provide a lens to view a protest through. The folks at the protest against lockdown on May 20th 2020 (the Michigan Conservative Coalition “Operation Haircut”) are notably white. File numbers 000_1RY8W9, 000_1RY96J, 000_1RY8WW, 000_1RY8WT, and 000_1RY8W6 are the only pics of Jeff Kowalsky / AFP - <a href="https://www.afpforum.com/AFPForum/Search/Results.aspx?fst=michigan+demonstration&amp;pn=1&amp;smd=8&amp;mui=3&amp;fto=1#">looking through the pics here</a> that have a Black person who is not a cop policing the demonstration in them - and I think this is all the same guy getting a haircut (one is a bit far away to tell - the others are close enough to be pretty sure despite him wearing a mask). Likewise <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/6/10/21285542/hair-cut-protest-lockdown-culture-war">in this Vox story</a> all the pictures are white people.</p><p>Looking at the graphs above one can see that even low SEP white women have a lower death rate than Hispanic or Black women of intermediate SEP - and low SEP whit men are at about the same risk as Hispanic or Black men of intermediate SEP. That is one lens to view the composition of the protest through - a group of people who, knowing their racial identity, might be fairly sure that other people are going to suffer worse from COVID-19 than they are.</p><nav aria-label="Adjacent Posts"><ul><li> <a href="/blog/key-skills-demographics" rel="prev">&laquo; Key skills across age groups - the young, and those near to retirement</a></li></ul></nav></main><footer> <small><a href="https://github.com/byjosh/jekyll-netlify-boilerplate-accessible-menu">This is a fork</a> (of <a href="https://github.com/danurbanowicz/jekyll-netlify-boilerplate" rel="noopener">Jekyll Netlify Boilerplate</a> that is maintained by <a href="https://www.danurbanowicz.com" rel="noopener">Dan Urbanowicz</a>).</small></footer><script> document.body.style.setProperty('--scroll', "0rem"); document.body.classList.add("with-js"); window.addEventListener('scroll', () => { var scrollamount = (window.pageYOffset / (window.innerHeight * 0.1)); var scroll = "0rem"; if (scrollamount > 0 && scrollamount < 1) { scroll = (scrollamount) + "rem"; } if (scrollamount > 1) { scroll = "1rem"; } document.body.style.setProperty('--scroll', scroll); }, false); </script></body></html>
