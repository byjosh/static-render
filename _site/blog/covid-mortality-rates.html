specifically <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/deathsbyvaccinationstatusengland/deathsoccurringbetween1january2021and31may2022/referencetable06072022accessible.xlsx">Table 2: Monthly age-standardised mortality rates by vaccination status by age group for all cause deaths, deaths involving COVID-19 and deaths not involving COVID-19, per 100,000 person-years, England, deaths occurring between 1 January 2021 and 31 May 2022 in the version to 31st May edition</a>.</p><p>Following graphs that are ASMR/100k person-yrs means it is graphing Age Standardised Mortality Rate per 100 thousand person-years. <em>NoVax</em> refers to those not vaccinated against COVID-19, <em>2nd &gt; 3 wks ago</em> is those who had a 2nd dose but more than 21 days ago (the ONS denotes the groups in days since dose but I use 3 weeks as it compacts more than 21 days), likewise <em>3rd &lt; 3 wks ago</em>, and <em>3rd &gt; 3 wks ago</em> is those who had a 3rd dose or booster fewer than or more than 21 days ago.</p><h2 id="partial-all-cause-mortality---80-89yr-olds---asmr100k-person-yrs"><em>Partial </em>all cause mortality - 80-89yr olds - ASMR/100k person-yrs</h2><p>This is <em>a very partial view of the all cause mortality statistics</em> which I am only showing to show how one can start with a misleading graph and through understanding the statistics better see what the real situation is. So the following shows correctly that official statistics have the age standardised mortality rate (ASMR) per 100 thousand person-years (person-yrs - i.e. counting the number of people in that age group for the time period) is <em>higher</em> among those who have had two vaccine doses against COVID-19 (more than 3 weeks ago) or have had a 3rd or booster dose less than 21 days ago have higher all cause mortality than those who have had no vaccine doses.</p><p id="placeholder0"></p><p>So why is it is misleading? Well your first clue that it might be true but misleading (and not proof of antivaxer conspiracy theories) is that it is only a few months data - specifically February, March &amp; April of 2022.</p><p>The 2nd is looking at vaccine uptake statistics for the over 80s (the dark red line punctuated with triangles on the left of both the following graphs).</p><figure> <img src="../assets/img/uploads/Dose_2_uptake_Weekly_Flu_and_COVID-19_report_w27.pdf.png"><figcaption>Dose 2 uptake from page 67 of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-flu-and-covid-19-surveillance-reports-2021-to-2022-season">Weekly Flu and COVID-19 report </a><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1088929/Weekly_Flu_and_COVID-19_report_w27.pdf">week 27 report</a> - <a href="https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/">used under Open Government v3 license</a></figcaption></figure><em>Note by about week 21 of 2021 the uptake of a 2nd dose is over 90% and 3 weeks from the vaccination of those who got the update to 90% - i.e.week 21 is 3 weeks from week in which the line hit 90% uptake</em><figure> <img src="../assets/img/uploads/Dose_3_uptake_Weekly_Flu_and_COVID-19_report_w27.pdf.png"><figcaption>Dose 3 uptake from page 67 of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-flu-and-covid-19-surveillance-reports-2021-to-2022-season">Weekly Flu and COVID-19 report </a><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1088929/Weekly_Flu_and_COVID-19_report_w27.pdf">week 27 report</a> - <a href="https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/">used under Open Government v3 license</a></figcaption></figure><em>Note by about week 02 of 2022 the uptake of a 3rd does or booster is over 90% and 3 weeks from the vaccination of those who got the update to 90% - i.e. week 02 of 2022 (mid January 2022) is 3 weeks from week in which the line hit 90% uptake</em><p>I.e. the thing to note from both those graphs is that by the time Feb/Mar/April have rolled around the vast majority of people have taken a 2nd <em>AND</em> a 3rd dose - those 80-89yrs old getting vaccinated in Feb/Mar/April are the latecomers (and some are now unfortunately late in the sense of <em>deceased</em>).</p><p>What hypotheses might one have about elderly people who are unvaccinated or get vaccinated late?</p><ul><li>Given the overall evidence for vaccination one can say that those who get vaccinated late or at all perhaps don’t listen to their doctor - and this might mean they miss out on other evidence based treatments.</li><li>Late vaccination might also be a sign of a lack of trust or social inclusion or a lack of care - e.g. people from an ethnic minority that has been mistreated, from people in poverty without access to information or from people outside of institutions - where they would have been included in an institutional vaccination program if they had been in the institution.</li><li>For the unvaccinated it may mean rightly or wrong that they think they are healthier (either they correctly perceive their ability to survive an infection without a vaccine is better than average - or they are in denial).</li><li>For those who are early or on time with vaccination one might hypothesis: social inclusion &amp; trust, scientific literacy, economic privilege (the health and resources to travel if necessary to a vaccine appointment).</li></ul><p>Together this might mean those who are late to vaccination face other health disadvantages compared to those who are vaccinated with the rest of their age group. And that the unvaccinated might be a healthier group compared to those who will take a vaccine (vaccine takers perhaps correctly perceiving either or both of the vaccine’s benefits and their personal vulnerability).</p><p>Conversely if the antivaxer theory was correct - in that vaccination was very harmful - then we might expect to see all cause mortality in the 3 wks after vaccination or in the vaccinated vs the unvaccinated to be elevated most of the time (supposedly bad vaccines not being a seasonal thing).</p><p>So we would expect if the antivaxer theory was true to see this elevated mortality among the recently vaccinated to be true across - or for it to disappear because those late to booster vaccination or just on two doses are different compared the unvaccinated and those who get vaccinated in a timely manner.</p><h2 id="all-cause-mortality---80-89yr-olds---asmr100k-person-yrs">All cause mortality - 80-89yr olds - ASMR/100k person-yrs</h2><p>Here is the all cause mortality for a longer period. Remember if one consults the 3rd or booster dose uptake graph above - by December those who have not have a 3rd dose or who only had it recently are the last quarter of the age group.</p><p id="placeholder1"></p><p>Looking at the early time period October, November, December it is clear that those vaccinated with a 3rd dose less than 21 days ago are not suffering a higher mortality rate! When it starts to rise is when a couple of things start to be true - 1) it is winter - never a good time for NHS healthcare 2) people in this group now comprise latecomers to vaccination - who for all the reasons above might be worse off in health and social status terms relatively speaking.</p><p>As to the ASMR rising much above that of the unvaccinated for those who have two doses - one can’t be sure (the above is a lot of hypotheses - hypotheses more reasonable than antivaxer conspiracy theories). However it may be that the unvaccinated 80-89yr olds are shaped by survivor bias - those who made it to this age and won’t take a vaccine are the ones who survived that kind of attitude for decades - and they are the hardy survivors. Whereas those who took a couple of doses both acknowledged their vulnerability and yet do not benefit from the more durable benefits of those who had the vaccine with most of their age group. To get a real answer and not hypotheses one would need to have individual level data, code for pre-existing conditions (perhaps tough if antivaxers won’t be screened medically), and then having matched for health status otherwise (along with obvious confounders like gender and class) see if that elevated mortality rate in the double vaccinated persists (the graph suggests it is seasonal).</p><p><a href="#main">Back to top</a></p><h2 id="deaths-involving-covid-19---80-89yr-olds---asmr100k-person-yrs">Deaths involving COVID-19 - 80-89yr olds - ASMR/100k person-yrs</h2><p id="placeholder2"></p><p>As one can see here folks with 3 vax doses are doing better at all times - often very significantly better. Note that the decline in vaccine effectiveness with time for the COVID-19 vaccinations is documented - e.g. <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1069256/Vaccine_surveillance_report_-_week_15.pdf">page 10 here</a>. So in the absence of proper controls one cannot draw strong conclusions about the rise of deaths among those who have been given 2 doses not 3 - one can just note they are an unusual population (like the unvaccinated) in terms of being latecomers. But it seems a bit firmer on the basis of these graphs alone - let alone the rest of the scientific literature - that if the vaccine really was terrible then the unvaccinated persistently having higher all cause mortality in the autumn would not be consistent with a vaccine being so terrible as to undo any health benefits of being part of a majority following scientific advice &amp; social norms (which the lower mortality groups in the autumn might be seen to be doing generally).</p><p>These are deaths involving COVID-19 (not “due to COVID-19” which indicates it was the underlying cause in ONS terminology). From the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/deathsbyvaccinationstatusengland/deathsoccurringbetween1january2021and31may2022/referencetable06072022accessible.xlsx">definition sheet</a>:-<blockquote>For this analysis we define a death as involving COVID-19 if either of the ICD10 codes U07.1 (COVID-19, virus identified) or U07.2 (COVID-19, virus not identified) is mentioned on the death certificate. In contrast to the definition used in the weekly deaths released, deaths where the ICD10 code U09.9 (Post-COVID condition, where the acute COVID had ended before the condition immediately causing death occurred) is mentioned on the death certificate and neither of the other two COVID-19 codes are mentioned are not included, as they are likely to be the result of an infection caught a long time previously, and therefore not linked to the vaccination status of the person at date of death.</blockquote></p><p>I take that definition to mean an infection characteristic of COVID but without a positive test - U07.2 (COVID-19, virus not identified) - or an infection with a positive test - U07.1 (COVID-19, virus identified) - on the death certificate is seen as relevant to a deaths by vaccination status - but not a previous infection - the acute phase of which might have ended months before.</p><p><a href="#main">Back to top</a></p><h2 id="non-covid-19-deaths---80-89yr-olds">Non COVID-19 deaths - 80-89yr olds</h2><p id="placeholder3"></p><p><a href="#main">Back to top</a></p><h2 id="deaths-involving-covid-19---60-69yr-olds---asmr100k-person-yrs">Deaths involving COVID-19 - 60-69yr olds - ASMR/100k person-yrs</h2><figure style="max-width: 100vw;"><p id="placeholder4"></p></figure><p>This is a particularly important graph for using age standardised mortality rate.
