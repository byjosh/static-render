So the following shows correctly that official statistics have the age standardised mortality rate (ASMR) per 100 thousand person-years (person-yrs - i.e. counting the number of people in that age group for the time period) as <em>higher</em> among those who have had two vaccine doses against COVID-19 (more than 3 weeks ago) or have had a 3rd or booster dose less than 21 days ago than those who have had no vaccine doses.</p><figure><p id="placeholder0"></p><figcaption><p>Figure 1</p></figcaption></figure><p>So why is it is misleading? First clue it might be strictly true but yet utterly misleading (and not proof of antivaxer conspiracy theories) is that it’s only a few months data.</p><p>The TLDR; for the impatient: yellow circle in image below is the above graph - the green circled data is what tells us that a simplistic antivax conclusion is not even supported by the same data series.</p><figure><p><img src="../assets/img/uploads/full_all_cause_80_89yr_ASMR.png" alt="Sept 2021 to April 2022 all cause mortality age standardised mortality rate for 80 to 89 year olds - showing, circled in yellow on right for February to March 2022, that previous graph is a partial picture that ignores period then those double vaccinated and the recently boosted had lower mortality rates than the unvaccinated - area circled in green on left - September to October 2022 for the double vaccinated and September to December for the recently recipients of a booster or third dose" /></p><figcaption><p>Figure 2</p></figcaption></figure><p>The second clue is looking at the confidence interval or confidence limits. For those who have not done inferential statistics: confidence limits rely on the data (such as the average height of people in a group) reasonably conforming to a mathematical model - then based on the known properties of that model and given a number of data points measured under the right conditions (a proper sample of e.g. people’s heights in a group) one can calculate the confidence interval or limits - this is the range of values that one is sure the real value of the number for the entire population of data points (e.g. the true average found if one measures everyone’s height in the group) lies within - on a specified number of occasions where one tries to measure data like this (e.g. trying to determine the average height of people in various groups such as countries or cities).</p><p>Or in words: given a sample the upper and lower 95% confidence limits for a statistic signifies: provided the data is a good fit to the model then in only 1 time in 20 would we expect the true value of the statistic to be above the upper confidence limit or below the lower limit. As an example: using the LA Lakers team ordered alphabetically by surname from the first 6 heights in a 17 member team I calculate a mean of 2.005 metres as the sample height with confidence limits of 1.906 and 2.105 - and the entire team does turn out to have a mean height of 2.003 metres (as at Wikipedia stats on 3rd Sept 2022). The 6 member sample based on surname is adequately random as we have no reason to believe players with surnames starting with B or C are going to be systematically taller or shorter than those with surnames starting with S or W.</p><p>Having understood that basic idea of a confidence limit here is ASMR and confidence limit data for December for the <em>3rd &lt; 3 wks ago</em> group of 80-89yr olds. With the all cause ASMR for the unvaccinated at 9.6k per hundred thousand in March and April note the lower confidence limit for <em>3rd &lt; 3 wks ago</em> is below that at 8.45k in March and not much above for April (10.2k). Note that in December the upper and lower confidence limits are within 10% of the calculated ASMR (it’s ~7%) - while the March and April ones are much wide (up to ~35% less on the lower limit and up to ~46%) more on the higher limit. When one notes the March and April statistics are based on less than 5% of the deaths and less than 3% of the person-years of all cause ASMR in December one gets an intuitive feels for why the March/April figures are a lot less certain with a lot wider confidence intervals than the December figure.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Month</th><th>Count of deaths</th><th>Person-years</th><th>Age-standardised mortality rate / 100,000 person-years</th><th>Noted as Unreliable</th><th>Lower confidence limit</th><th>Upper confidence limit</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Dec 2021</td><td>942</td><td>9777</td><td>9421.2</td><td> </td><td>8815.9</td><td>10026.5</td></tr><tr><td>Mar 2022</td><td>27</td><td>201</td><td>12883.6</td><td> </td><td>8451.6</td><td>18796.8</td></tr><tr><td>April 2022</td><td>39</td><td>262</td><td>14403.5</td><td> </td><td>10202.0</td><td>19741.2</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The third clue is looking at vaccine uptake statistics for the over 80s (the dark red line punctuated with triangles on the left of both the following graphs).</p><h3 id="2nddoseuptake">2nd dose uptake</h3><figure> <img src="../assets/img/uploads/Dose_2_uptake_Weekly_Flu_and_COVID-19_report_w27.pdf.png"><figcaption>Figure 3: Dose 2 uptake from page 67 of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-flu-and-covid-19-surveillance-reports-2021-to-2022-season">Weekly Flu and COVID-19 report </a><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1088929/Weekly_Flu_and_COVID-19_report_w27.pdf">week 27 report</a> - <a href="https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/">used under Open Government v3 license</a></figcaption></figure><em>Note by about week 18 of 2021 the uptake of a 2nd dose is at 90% and 3 weeks from that is week 21 - when uptake is over 90% and those who got the uptake to 90% have all had 3 weeks from their vaccination. <strong>So folks shown in figure 1 or figure 2 as only having had 2 doses are unusual & in last 10% by the end of 2021.</strong> </em><h3 id="3rddoseuptake">3rd dose uptake</h3><figure> <img src="../assets/img/uploads/Dose_3_uptake_Weekly_Flu_and_COVID-19_report_w27.pdf.png"><figcaption>Figure 4: Dose 3 uptake from page 67 of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-flu-and-covid-19-surveillance-reports-2021-to-2022-season">Weekly Flu and COVID-19 report </a><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1088929/Weekly_Flu_and_COVID-19_report_w27.pdf">week 27 report</a> - <a href="https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/">used under Open Government v3 license</a></figcaption></figure><em>Note by about week 51 or 52 of 2021 the uptake of a 3rd does or booster is at 90% and 3 weeks from then is week 02 or 03 of 2022 - so by week 02 or 03 those who got the uptake to 90% have had 3 weeks from their last vaccination. <strong>So in figure 1 or figure 2 the folks who have had 3 doses by end of 2021 are the vast majority (90%) and those who have had a dose in last few weeks in Feb 2022 or later are a small group of latecomers.</strong> </em><p>I.e. the thing to note from both those vaccine uptake graphs is that by the time Feb/Mar/April have rolled around the vast majority of people have taken a 2nd <em>AND</em> a 3rd dose - those 80-89yrs old getting vaccinated in Feb/Mar/April are the latecomers (and some are now unfortunately late in the sense of <em>deceased</em>).</p><p>What hypotheses might one have about elderly people who are unvaccinated or get vaccinated late?</p><ul><li>Given the overall evidence for vaccination one can say that those who get vaccinated late or at all perhaps don’t listen to their doctor - and this might mean they miss out on other evidence based treatments.</li><li>Late vaccination might also be a sign of a lack of trust or social inclusion or a lack of care - e.g. people from an ethnic minority that has been mistreated, from people in poverty without access to information or from people outside of institutions - where they would have been included in an institutional vaccination program if they had been in the institution.</li><li>For the unvaccinated it may mean rightly or wrong that they think they are healthier (either they correctly perceive their ability to survive an infection without a vaccine is better than average - or they are in denial).</li><li>For those who are early or on time with vaccination one might hypothesis: social inclusion &amp; trust, scientific literacy, economic privilege (the health and resources to travel if necessary to a vaccine appointment).</li></ul><p>Together this might mean those who are late to vaccination face other health disadvantages compared to those who are vaccinated with the rest of their age group. And that the unvaccinated might be a healthier group compared to those who will take a vaccine (vaccine takers perhaps correctly perceiving either or both of the vaccine’s benefits and their personal vulnerability).</p><p>Conversely if the antivaxer theory was correct - in that vaccination was very harmful - then we might expect to see all cause mortality in the 3 wks after vaccination or in the vaccinated vs the unvaccinated to be elevated most of the time (supposedly bad vaccines not being a seasonal thing).</p><p>So we would expect if the antivaxer theory was true to see this elevated mortality among the recently vaccinated to be true across - or for it to disappear because those late to booster vaccination or just on two doses are different compared the unvaccinated and those who get vaccinated in a timely manner.</p><p><a href="#main">Back to top</a></p><h2 id="all-cause-mortality---80-89yr-olds---asmr100k-person-yrs">All cause mortality - 80-89yr olds - ASMR/100k person-yrs</h2><p>Here is the all cause mortality for a longer period. Remember if one consults the 3rd or booster dose uptake graph above - by December those who have not have a 3rd dose or who only had it recently are the last quarter of the age group.</p><figure><p id="placeholder1"></p><figcaption><p>Figure 5</p></figcaption></figure><p>Looking at the early time period October, November, December it is clear that those vaccinated with a 3rd dose less than 21 days ago are not suffering a higher mortality rate! When it starts to rise is when a couple of things start to be true - 1) it is winter - never a good time for NHS healthcare 2) people in this group now comprise latecomers to vaccination - who for all the reasons above might be worse off in health and social status terms relatively speaking.</p><p>As to the ASMR rising much above that of the unvaccinated for those who have two doses - one can’t be sure (the above is a lot of hypotheses - hypotheses more reasonable than antivaxer conspiracy theories). However it may be that the unvaccinated 80-89yr olds are shaped by survivor bias - those who made it to this age and won’t take a vaccine are the ones who survived that kind of attitude for decades - and they are the hardy survivors. Whereas those who took a couple of doses both acknowledged their vulnerability and yet do not benefit from the more durable benefits of those who had the vaccine with most of their age group. To get a real answer and not hypotheses one would need to have individual level data, code for pre-existing conditions (perhaps tough if antivaxers won’t be screened medically), and then having matched for health status otherwise (along with obvious confounders like gender and class) see if that elevated mortality rate in the double vaccinated persists (the graph suggests it is seasonal).</p><p><a href="#main">Back to top</a></p><h2 id="deaths-involving-covid-19---80-89yr-olds---asmr100k-person-yrs">Deaths involving COVID-19 - 80-89yr olds - ASMR/100k person-yrs</h2><figure><p id="placeholder2"></p><figcaption><p>Figure 6</p></figcaption></figure><p>As one can see here folks with 3 vax doses are doing better at all times - often very significantly better. Note that the decline in vaccine effectiveness with time for the COVID-19 vaccinations is documented - e.g. <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1069256/Vaccine_surveillance_report_-_week_15.pdf">page 10 here</a>. So in the absence of proper controls one cannot draw strong conclusions about the rise of deaths among those who have been given 2 doses not 3 - one can just note they are an unusual population (like the unvaccinated) in terms of being latecomers. But it seems a bit firmer on the basis of these graphs alone - let alone the rest of the scientific literature - that if the vaccine really was terrible then the unvaccinated persistently having higher all cause mortality in the autumn would not be consistent with a vaccine being so terrible as to undo any health benefits of being part of a majority following scientific advice &amp; social norms (which the lower mortality groups in the autumn might be seen to be doing generally).</p><p>These are deaths involving COVID-19 (not “due to COVID-19” which indicates it was the underlying cause in ONS terminology).

In contrast to the definition used in the weekly deaths released, deaths where the ICD10 code U09.9 (Post-COVID condition, where the acute COVID had ended before the condition immediately causing death occurred) is mentioned on the death certificate and neither of the other two COVID-19 codes are mentioned are not included, as they are likely to be the result of an infection caught a long time previously, and therefore not linked to the vaccination status of the person at date of death.</blockquote></p><p>I take that definition to mean an infection characteristic of COVID but without a positive test - U07.2 (COVID-19, virus not identified) - or an infection with a positive test - U07.1 (COVID-19, virus identified) - on the death certificate is seen as relevant to a deaths by vaccination status - but not a previous infection - the acute phase of which might have ended months before.</p><p><a href="#main">Back to top</a></p><h2 id="non-covid-19-deaths---80-89yr-olds">Non COVID-19 deaths - 80-89yr olds</h2><figure><p id="placeholder3"></p><figcaption><p>Figure 7</p></figcaption></figure><p><a href="#main">Back to top</a></p><h2 id="deaths-involving-covid-19---60-69yr-olds---asmr100k-person-yrs">Deaths involving COVID-19 - 60-69yr olds - ASMR/100k person-yrs</h2><figure style="max-width: 100vw;"><p id="placeholder4"></p><figcaption><p>Figure 8</p></figcaption></figure><p>This is a particularly important graph for using age standardised mortality rate.
