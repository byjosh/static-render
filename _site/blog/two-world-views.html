the explanation centres on the idea that people whose estrangement from their kids is due to a specific issue (drugs, an abusive partner, maybe a past custody decision) will get help that addresses the specific issue and leave - so for the parents who remain long-term on the forum the issue is more likely the parents than for new arrivals on the forums.</p><h2 id="two-world-views---emotion-first-or-reality-first">Two world views - emotion first or reality first</h2><p>A particularly insightful page is <a href="https://www.issendai.com/psychology/estrangement/missing-missing-reasons.html">the one on the missing missing reasons</a> - about estranged parents lack of explanation on the forums of the reasons their child has apparently not given for the estrangement (but in reality the children tend to have explained - so the these apparently missing reasons are missing only on the forums).</p><p>The key points is a duality in world views between starting with emotion and shaping reality to suit and starting with reality and shaping emotion to suit. As I said this is not peer-reviewed research - but does seem interesting.</p><p>If you have difficulties resolving a dispute that relates to a situation with unclear facts or regarding something scientific then looking at whether a person in general is liable to put their emotions &amp; whether things feel right at the center of their approach - or liable to put gathering information and evaluating it to try to see what the reality might be as their main approach.</p><h2 id="political-views-and-relationship-to-parenting-style">Political views and relationship to parenting style</h2><p>There is <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/363194735_Belief_in_a_Dangerous_World_Does_Not_Explain_Substantial_Variance_in_Political_Attitudes_But_Other_World_Beliefs_Do">a peer-reviewed 2022 paper Jeremy D.W. Clifton and Nicholas Kerry exploring a safe vs dangerous world belief</a> (only skimmed it - enough to notice there is some inter-sample variability). The idea is that “safe vs dangerous world” is a belief that might explain for instance why conservatives spend more on the military. The paper says the idea is strong enough that new measures of conservatism are validated against conservatives viewing the world as more dangerous.</p><p>What the paper uncovers is that there are other beliefs that much better correlate with conservatism. Using <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328180484_Primal_World_Beliefs">a set of primal world beliefs evaluated by Clifton et al. in 2019</a> the 2022 paper of Clifton and Kerry finds the belief the world is hierarchical is much the best correlate to conservatism - much better than the idea that the world is a dangerous place.</p><p>The relationship to parenting style is that if one looks at <a href="https://www.issendai.com/psychology/estrangement/dysfunctional-beliefs.html">the dysfunctional beliefs page on issendai.com</a> - which details dysfunctional beliefs common both on the forums and outside - there are quite hierarchical beliefs there. E.g. that parents set the terms of the relationship and never the children, meeting parental expectations is the most important yardstick for the child.</p><h2 id="a-toxic-mix">A toxic mix</h2><p>So combining the elements of an emotion first worldview, the inability to engage with the reasons given for an estrangement and some quite hierarchical beliefs it is fairly understandable how some parents self-select to be stuck on the forums for years. If the parent is not going to listen to reality, not going to listen to a child who has grown into an adult - and has some quite hierarchical beliefs - the estrangement for the adult child can fairly easily be seen as an escape to freedom and reality.</p><nav aria-label="Adjacent Posts"><ul><li> <a href="/blog/comparison" rel="prev">&laquo; Comparison of vaccinated countries and US/Europe</a></li><li> <a href="/blog/competence-as-a-grid" rel="next">The process of improvement - why some pain? &raquo;</a></li></ul></nav></main><footer> <small><a href="https://github.com/byjosh/jekyll-netlify-boilerplate-accessible-menu">This is a fork</a> (of <a href="https://github.com/danurbanowicz/jekyll-netlify-boilerplate" rel="noopener">Jekyll Netlify Boilerplate</a> that is maintained by <a href="https://www.danurbanowicz.com" rel="noopener">Dan Urbanowicz</a>).</small></footer><script> document.body.style.setProperty('--scroll', "0rem"); document.body.classList.add("with-js"); window.addEventListener('scroll', () => { var scrollamount = (window.pageYOffset / (window.innerHeight * 0.1)); var scroll = "0rem"; if (scrollamount > 0 && scrollamount < 1) { scroll = (scrollamount) + "rem"; } if (scrollamount > 1) { scroll = "1rem"; } document.body.style.setProperty('--scroll', scroll); }, false); </script></body></html>
