Can you name any others?” is questioning that may prime British people to, rightly, recall <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristallnacht">Kristallnacht</a> with its paramilitary assault on Jewish businesses - and the step by step exclusion and murder of Jews by the state in Nazi Germany (starting with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_for_the_Restoration_of_the_Professional_Civil_Service">Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service/Gesetz zur Wiederherstellung des Berufsbeamtentums</a>).</p><p>The “Can you name any others?” prompt - particularly for white British people - may be the point to discuss how the racism of British colonialism is avoided or forgotten or denied by a good chunk of the British.</p><p>Even the removal of restrictions was not aimed at liberation but at control: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swynnerton_Plan">the Swynnerton Plan in Kenya</a>, in the words of the Special Commissioner of the Central Province, had as an aim “to confirm the landlessness of the rebels” by putting confiscated land into a common land pool - as well as, via land consolidation, creating a middle class (<a href="https://archive.org/details/decolonizationin0000unse/">p50 in Ogot, Bethwell et al. (eds.) Decolonization and Independence in Kenya, 1940–93</a>). So Kenyan tea farming being opened up before that of Malawi has less to do with any kind of benevolent administration and more to do with a reaction happening in the context of a rebellion to colonial control. And this reaction was aimed at retaining control rather than conferring freedom.</p><nav aria-label="Adjacent Posts"><ul><li> <a href="/blog/US-covid-death-rate-by-race-education" rel="prev">&laquo; US working age COVID-19 mortality rates - by race, gender and socioeconomic position</a></li><li> <a href="/blog/sorting-visualisations" rel="next">Comparing sort algorithm visualisations &raquo;</a></li></ul></nav></main><footer> <small><a href="https://github.com/byjosh/jekyll-netlify-boilerplate-accessible-menu">This is a fork</a> (of <a href="https://github.com/danurbanowicz/jekyll-netlify-boilerplate" rel="noopener">Jekyll Netlify Boilerplate</a> that is maintained by <a href="https://www.danurbanowicz.com" rel="noopener">Dan Urbanowicz</a>).</small></footer><script> document.body.style.setProperty('--scroll', "0rem"); document.body.classList.add("with-js"); window.addEventListener('scroll', () => { var scrollamount = (window.pageYOffset / (window.innerHeight * 0.1)); var scroll = "0rem"; if (scrollamount > 0 && scrollamount < 1) { scroll = (scrollamount) + "rem"; } if (scrollamount > 1) { scroll = "1rem"; } document.body.style.setProperty('--scroll', scroll); }, false); </script></body></html>
