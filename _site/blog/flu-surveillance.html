But in case more information help the graph on the following page, Figure 31, was also quite striking and showing that COVID-19 consultation rates far exceeding historical flu consultation rates - a point in rebuttal to any “old diseases, new labels” thinking. The key points to me in the graph are the much higher consulation rates for COVID-19 - and the later peaks outside of influenza season.</p><p><img src="/assets/img/uploads/flu-surveillance/Fig_31_ILI_w27.pdf.png" alt="Graph labelled Figure 31 shows Royal College of General Practitioners influenza like illness consultation rate for all ages in England per 100 thousand - and the lower respiratory tract infections consultation rate and COVID-19 indicator - the COVID-19 indicator dwarfs the 2010-11 flu consultation rate seen in previous graph peaking at over 1200 per 100k in January 2022 - the lower respiratory tract infections consultation rate stays below about 50 and the influenza like illness consultation rate is even lower - just a flat line at bottom of graph - the COVID-19 indicator also starts peaking around week 12 and ascending again around week 27" /></p><p>Cross-referencing with the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/coronaviruscovid19infectionsurveypilot/1april2022">ONS coronavirus infection survey for week ending 26th of March 2022</a> that had about 1 in 13 people having COVID-19 during that week - which was in week 13 around the time of the peak of 600 per 100k seen in Figure 31’s COVID-19 indicator.</p><h2 id="indicator-caveats">Indicator caveats</h2><p>One needs to bear in mind with all these indicators that consultations depending on getting through to a GP (and same day GP appointments unless urgent is unlikely where I am). But with that in mind the much lower consulation rate might indicate more asymptomatic or less severe cases. The lower mortality rates, <a href="/asmr-by-vaccination-status">seen here</a>, among the unvaccinated for Omicron definitely indicates it is hitting the survivors less hard than previous variants.</p><h2 id="flu-is-falling">Flu is falling</h2><p>But beyond caveats about the indicators I have on the <a href="/pandemic-scientific-papers">pandemic scientific papers page here</a>a couple of papers showing pretty clearly that flu is having a harder time spreading - so much so that [a lineage has quite possibly gone extinct]https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-021-00642-4) - likely due to a combination of coronavirus infection control measures and the lack of an animal reservior for that lineage (basically animals who will get the flu and not practice social distancing - as hey they are animals).</p><nav aria-label="Adjacent Posts"><ul><li> <a href="/blog/competence-as-a-grid" rel="prev">&laquo; The pain in improvement as a 2 by 2 grid</a></li><li> <a href="/blog/key-skills-demographics" rel="next">Key skills across age groups - the young, and those near to retirement &raquo;</a></li></ul></nav></main><footer> <small><a href="https://github.com/byjosh/jekyll-netlify-boilerplate-accessible-menu">This is a fork</a> (of <a href="https://github.com/danurbanowicz/jekyll-netlify-boilerplate" rel="noopener">Jekyll Netlify Boilerplate</a> that is maintained by <a href="https://www.danurbanowicz.com" rel="noopener">Dan Urbanowicz</a>).</small></footer><script> document.body.style.setProperty('--scroll', "0rem"); document.body.classList.add("with-js"); window.addEventListener('scroll', () => { var scrollamount = (window.pageYOffset / (window.innerHeight * 0.1)); var scroll = "0rem"; if (scrollamount > 0 && scrollamount < 1) { scroll = (scrollamount) + "rem"; } if (scrollamount > 1) { scroll = "1rem"; } document.body.style.setProperty('--scroll', scroll); }, false); </script></body></html>
