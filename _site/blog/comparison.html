So AUS/NZ, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan have had COVID spread like wildfire in their societies - without it turning into a the very steep and prolonged increases in deaths as seen in the UK particularly in Figure 1 but also seen in US/Germany/Ireland in winter 2021 - circumstances in which there was a lot less COVID (about <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/coronaviruscovid19infectionsurveypilot/22january2021">1 in 55 people or so in England according to the ONS Coronavirus infection survey for January 2021</a> compared to <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/coronaviruscovid19infectionsurveypilot/8april2022">1 in 13 in April 2022</a>)</p><figure><p><img src="/assets/img/uploads/comparison/coronavirus-data-explorer_vaccinations.svg" /></p><figcaption><p>Figure 4</p></figcaption></figure><p>Here is figure 1 again to remind you of what that increase looks like</p><figure><p><img src="/assets/img/uploads/comparison/coronavirus-data-explorer_deaths.svg" /></p><figcaption><p>Figure 1</p></figcaption></figure><p>Now one could think “Do COVID deaths actually mean the overall death rate is genuinely increased?” i.e. some folks might entertain a suspicion that there is relabelling a normal quantity of deaths. Well here is Figure 5 showing excess mortality (when deaths are increasing above what we would expect given pre-pandemic deaths). Again look up at Figure 1 - apart from a sharp climb in South Korea the countries do not look like the countries of in the East do not look like US/Western European ones.</p><figure><p><img src="/assets/img/uploads/comparison/coronavirus-data-explorer_excess_mortality.svg" /></p><figcaption><p>Figure 5</p></figcaption></figure><p>Now the “Ooh experimental vaccine” minority will try to suggest the all cause increase in mortality is due to vaccine - they don’t need to prove this idea because they care about fear rather than facts. But below is figure 6 - the percentage of people who have had a 1st dose of vaccine. And specifically % on Feb 24th a point on Figure 5 where one can see the jumps in all cause mortality. And vaccinated people are a distinct minority and more to the point - the other countries that all get vaccinated later in the year do not see a jump in all cause mortality.</p><figure><p><img src="/assets/img/uploads/comparison/vaccination_status.png" /></p><figcaption><p>Figure 6</p></figcaption></figure><p>The only country that sees a sharp increase in all cause mortality that resembles US/Europe is South Korean - where on February 16th 2022 the cumulative confirmed COVID cases where 31,757 per million people - and two months later on April 16th 2022 they were 314,599 per million people - so there were COVID cases equivalent to 28% of the country in just 2 months. While South Korea vaccinated their people - more than any other in this group of countries - without any notable increase in mortality.</p><p>So here is Figure 1 and Figure 5 one last time. <strong>Lots of COVID deaths leads to increases in all cause mortality - not lots of vaccines.</strong></p><figure><p><img src="/assets/img/uploads/comparison/coronavirus-data-explorer_deaths.svg" /></p><figcaption><p>Figure 1</p></figcaption></figure><figure><p><img src="/assets/img/uploads/comparison/coronavirus-data-explorer_excess_mortality.svg" /></p><figcaption><p>Figure 5</p></figcaption></figure><nav aria-label="Adjacent Posts"><ul><li> <a href="/blog/on-ereaders" rel="prev">&laquo; On e-readers</a></li></ul></nav></main><footer> <small><a href="https://github.com/byjosh/jekyll-netlify-boilerplate-accessible-menu">This is a fork</a> (of <a href="https://github.com/danurbanowicz/jekyll-netlify-boilerplate" rel="noopener">Jekyll Netlify Boilerplate</a> that is maintained by <a href="https://www.danurbanowicz.com" rel="noopener">Dan Urbanowicz</a>).</small></footer><script> document.body.style.setProperty('--scroll', "0rem"); document.body.classList.add("with-js"); window.addEventListener('scroll', () => { var scrollamount = (window.pageYOffset / (window.innerHeight * 0.1)); var scroll = "0rem"; if (scrollamount > 0 && scrollamount < 1) { scroll = (scrollamount) + "rem"; } if (scrollamount > 1) { scroll = "1rem"; } document.body.style.setProperty('--scroll', scroll); }, false); </script></body></html>
