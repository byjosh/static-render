Currently I am trying to decide what license to put this entire example fork under.
Until then it is officially all rights reserved. 

This is an integration of two different menu styles into a template - designed to work with and without
JavaScript enabled.



So two things:
1. THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" - the DISCLAIMER sections (all CAPS paragraphs in licenses below), but not the rest of the terms of the licenses below, are included here regarding this fork by reference - in short: it is without warranty and I shall not be held liable for claims/damages/other liability. So officially all rights reserved right but if you take this for something - it is at your own risk.
2. While I investigate which license I might best agree with - if you satisfy the following three conditions:
   a) this work is not used for a business website nor used to make a website that is sold to third parties (so for a personal site or use internally by a not-for-profit/educational staff is fine)
   b) you acknowledge the source with a link to the repo (so my work is acknowledged)
   c) you acknowledge it is all rights reserved at the time of use (to prevent the work getting further distributed when it is not yet licensed) - and reference this file with the words "Parts of this site/code derives from https://github.com/byjosh/jekyll-netlify-boilerplate-accessible-menu which when this site/code was first made was a fork that was copyrighted with all rights reserved - please see early commits of LICENSE file of that fork for details of the conditions needed for the use not to be infringing" in an acknowledgements or license section to make clear the source of the work and the circumstances in which I may not regard use as infringing.
