The term is seen in the context of investing - <a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/corporate-governance/publications/assets/pwc-risk-appetite-management.pdf">PriceWaterhouseCoopers explaining it</a> as the amount of risk an organisation is willing to accept to pursue its strategic objectives; note these are not any old objectives (if they were perhaps “very high risk tolerance” or “very low risk tolerance” might best describe the extremes).</p><p><em>Public health</em>: <a href="https://www.cdcfoundation.org/what-public-health">As this CDC Foundation page puts it:</a> public health is concerned with protecting the health of entire populations. This is constrast with individual health care decisions that affect only the health of individual making the decision.</p><p><em>Eugenics</em>: <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/eugenics">basically involves treating people like cattle - thinking of human reproduction in terms of selective breeding programs</a>.</p><h2 id="risk-clash">Risk clash</h2><p>To illustrate the clash: can you name <a href="https://www.food.gov.uk/business-guidance/allergen-guidance-for-food-businesses">the 14 allergens that food businesses need to tell customers about if the allergen is an ingredient</a> ? (Without you knowing from running a food business or being trained as part of one).</p><p>I could only name about 4 as allergens from general knowledge - and another from remembering a news story. The point of the illustration is that for those outside food businesses or who don’t know someone allergic &amp; are not allergic themselves it might be possible to go through life unaware of these potentially risky things and liberally making them part of one’s life. And by contrast a person suffering from the allergy - such as coeliac disease - will have a very different risk tolerance (in the case of coeliac disease likely a zero tolerance for anything that might have any gluten in it).</p><p>But, in this illustration, unless one goes through life with this oblivousness as a caterer the oblivousness or deliberate ignorance will not lead to interpersonal clashes as there is not also the paradigm clash.</p><h2 id="paradigm-clash">Paradigm clash</h2><p>Allergens - and people being ignorant of them (outside the role of catering &amp; food processing) are not a source of strife because the individual health model rather than the public health model will usually apply.</p><p>Under the individual health model the decisions a person makes affects their health - and not those of other people or the entire group.</p><p>For allergens the “You do you” model rightly criticised in the MTA mask policy tweet here actually applies if one is not a food producer!</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Beginning today, masks are encouraged but optional on <a href="https://twitter.com/NYCTSubway?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@NYCTSubway</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/NYCTBus?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@NYCTBus</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/LIRR?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@LIRR</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/MetroNorth?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@MetroNorth</a>. <a href="https://t.co/BMOea8nE67">pic.twitter.com/BMOea8nE67</a></p><p>— MTA (@MTA) <a href="https://twitter.com/MTA/status/1567541665652523011?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 7, 2022</a></p></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>One can have a pancake made of eggs, milk and wheat (three potential allergens) for breakfast - and that will not affect the health of fellow transit riders in a negative way.</p><p>By contrast: not masking - and consequently being more likely to transmit a coronavirus infection - is likely to affect fellow transit riders in a negative way (if one is unconvinced on this point have a look at <a href="/pandemic-scientific-papers">some scientific papers</a> that certainly point it being a consideration).</p><h2 id="battles-past---smoking">Battles past - smoking</h2><p>The dynamics of long road to reducing smoking seems the most appropriate comparison.</p><p>One has:</p><ul><li>ordinary people with something pleasurable and not wanting to change how they do it for other people - even if the scientific evidence points to changes being better for them and others in the longterm. (With smoking: the nicotine hit. With COVID: life as normal with unrestricted social contact.)</li><li>rich people not wanting to change things due to how it would affect their business model and bottom line. (With smoking: the tobacco industry. With COVID: commercial landlords wanting in-person offices as before, all kinds of institutions not wanting to spend on ventilation improvements &amp; enforcing public health measures).</li></ul><h2 id="not-the-past">Not the past</h2><p>But the smoking comparison is not good on all points. With smoking the the point is consistent restrictions in all public places and with all people unless one actively wants the damage oneself. With coronavirus there is not a clear point to having a close unmasked chat with one’s delivery driver or shop staff - by comparison having a close, unmasked Christmas with one’s in-laws has a point - and whether that point outweighs the risks can be shifted by the public health situation.</p><p>And the example of a family Christmas illustrates the point:- by using strong public health measures and reducing the population incidence of the disease the risks involved in a family Christmas would go down - and for those most at risk measures like guests isolating prior to Christmas and testing regularly during Christmas could lower it further.</p><p>Expressed in terms of R (the number of infections that a single infection on average leads to) - if the incidence of coronavirus is pushed down a lot and then measures mean that in most settings R is very much below one - and overall settings the R is usually below 1 then as a society we could have confidence that this is a low but tolerable risk - like deaths from road traffic collisions. But instead it is more like as a society places like the UK and US have suddenly decided to tolerate drunk driving by everyone - almost all the time (some healthcare settings and film sets perhaps being exceptions).</p><h2 id="film-sets---when-the-money-makes-the-rich-take-things-seriously">Film sets - when the money makes the rich take things seriously</h2><p>That the rich do not always take COVID seriously can be seen from the Emmy awards ceremony with Bill Hader seemingly the lone mask wearer. According to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/bill-hader-interview-barry-snl-anxiety-1235121564/">a Hollywood Reporter interview</a> he has an autoimmune disease - necessitating medication that suppresses his immune system leaving him immunocompromised.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Bill Hader is the only MF wearing a mask at the Emmys. As a person who has somehow made it this long without having gotten COVID, I have to respect it deeply <a href="https://t.co/OhTHxNm7SK">pic.twitter.com/OhTHxNm7SK</a></p><p>— Patrick Hosken (@patrickhosken) <a href="https://twitter.com/patrickhosken/status/1569509718254575617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 13, 2022</a></p></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>The reason that money makes film sets a place where COVID-19 migitations are taken more seriously has to do with the economics of film shoots and the non-substitutable nature of leading movie actors.</p><p>A film crew shooting will be paying cast and crew and other expenses like accommodation costs and equipment rental - which combined means a major movie shooting for a month is likely to cost hundreds of thousands of dollars per day.</p><p>Now if you are preparing financial accounts to a deadline and your chief financial officer (CFO) gets sicks there are deputies who can do the work (perhaps with the occasional piece of advice from the CFO if they are not too sick), a teacher can be substituted, a doctor can be replaced with a locum. But if shooting a Tom Cruise movie and Tom Cruise is sick when you can’t send on Jason Bateman in his place - unless one wants to turn it into a Jason Bateman movie! Similarly: if Jessica Chastain is sick one can’t simply rope in Amy Adams to play the role for a week or two.</p><p>The reshoot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_the_Money_in_the_World">All the Money in the World</a> - replacing Kevin Spacey with Christopher Plummer (in the wake of allegations against Spacey) - is rare enough to shown that it is not normal to switch out an actor after shooting many of their scenes.</p><p>So there is not really a barrier to taking COVID seriously if people with power and money have economic reasons to do so. Which is my reading on China’s coronavirus policy.</p><h2 id="a-stampede-of-cattle-breeders">A stampede of cattle breeders</h2><p>“Hardy, low vet’s bills, naturally resistant to parasites”.” - that’s a culturally acceptable description for cattle. But the pandemic has made very plain the popularity of criticising the vulnerable relative to a standard appropriate for cattle to prioritise for the less vulnerable all the things that make people not like cattle.</p><p>So eugenics hasn’t gone away quietly with the Third Reich. One can value people for their abilities or choices - or better yet simply as humans. But the irony of people who will push for cultural events without pushing equally for protections for the vulnerable is by that standard they would be unhelpful bystanders to the deaths of creatives - after all - Mozart died young <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Wolfgang-Amadeus-Mozart/The-last-year">for uncertain reasons</a> - but <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;span id="start" type="sarcasm"&gt;</code>maybe he had a weak immune system? And one doesn’t need to go back centuries for musicians who have had great talent but died young - but perhaps they were insufficiently hardy? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;/span id="end" type="sarcasm"&gt;</code></p><p>In the UK or US th lack of public health measures are a choice - mask wearing in East Asia particularly is much higher - and was before the pandemic.</p><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><p>So sources of conflict can be summarised as:</p><ul><li>due to risk tolerances &amp; appetites being different,</li><li>people being used in many cases to an individual health model rather than a public health model,</li><li>like smoking the pandemic has ordinary people in conflict over giving up things they find pleasurable and rich people in there fighting to preserve a profitable status quo,</li><li>some folks really like eugenic ideas so judging vulnerable folks for not being hardy like a good cattle breed - in service of the less vulnerable enjoying things (especially stuff that sets them apart from cattle) - is not problem for them.</li></ul><p>Unlike anti-smoking efforts of the past anti-COVID measures need not be consistent across all contexts - the context that matters most is a public health one - if the COVID incidence is kept extremely low so that deaths are at or below the level of benchmarks like road traffic deaths then risky behaviour at certain times and in certain contexts might be sensible - but so far, despite the success of vaccination, the death rate in the UK still resembles as if road traffic deaths got increased by the country deciding to have everyone drive drunk. That the death rate among under 40s is very low compared to total seems plausible as to why there is not a mass political movement of bereaved parents - and the success and coverage of vaccination in the elderly and the advanced age of most deaths likewise seems plausible re: the small size of the bereaved children as a movement.</p></main><footer> <small><a href="https://github.com/byjosh/jekyll-netlify-boilerplate-accessible-menu">This is a fork</a> (of <a href="https://github.com/danurbanowicz/jekyll-netlify-boilerplate" rel="noopener">Jekyll Netlify Boilerplate</a> that is maintained by <a href="https://www.danurbanowicz.com" rel="noopener">Dan Urbanowicz</a>).</small></footer><script> document.body.style.setProperty('--scroll', "0rem"); document.body.classList.add("with-js"); window.addEventListener('scroll', () => { var scrollamount = (window.pageYOffset / (window.innerHeight * 0.1)); var scroll = "0rem"; if (scrollamount > 0 && scrollamount < 1) { scroll = (scrollamount) + "rem"; } if (scrollamount > 1) { scroll = "1rem"; } document.body.style.setProperty('--scroll', scroll); }, false); </script></body></html>
