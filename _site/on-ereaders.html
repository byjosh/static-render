Provided the book can be loaded onto the e-reader (such as<a href="https://help.kobo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017814074"> using </a> the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/ca/solutions/ebook/digital-editions/download.html">Adobe Digital Editions</a> software if the book has DRM) then even a cheap ereader from a decade ago may do OK (having tried a few old e-readers - a lag opening a book - followed by a comparatively small but sometimes noticeable page turn lag - is the common issue).</p><p>For reference reading a computer or powerful conventional tablet (like an iPad) is actually the best format. One gets full text search cf. a printed book - and speed cf. an e-reader. And assuming the reading is to assist with something done at the computer: minimal task switching too!</p><p>Sequential reading of non-narrative books is where being discerning or sceptical (depending on your budget) regarding e-readers pays off.</p><p>A printed non-fiction book can be assure that the work of the author/publisher in placing the text/pictures/diagrams together in a logical manner is not wasted.</p><p>On an e-reader with the book in a format that uses reflowable text (i.e. EPUB or the Kindle format - not a PDF) the pages may break in ways that leave text or images stranded from what should accompany them. And if the book is as a PDF: on a standard 6 inch screen that will translate to tiny text or zooming in - so again losing the readability of a printed book.</p><p>In my experience an e-reader with a screen larger than 6 inches - 8 inches ideally - provide a much better experience for sequential reading of PDFs. So one gets the benefits of e-ink, legibility and humans doing the page design.</p><h2 id="what-if-one-wants-a-large-screen-e-reader">What if one wants a large screen e-reader?</h2><p>Currently: Amazon does not do Kindle with a screen above 7 inches (they did do the Kindle DX in the past but that seems hard to get 2nd hand). <a href="https://www.kobo.com/">Kobo</a> sells the Sage and Forma e-readers new.</p><p>Secondhand: the Kobo Forma or Aura One and the Onyx Boox Nova Pro 32GB 7.8’’ meet the criteria. One can choose rather high end stuff (a lot of Boox models or e.g. the <a href="https://remarkable.com/#Specifications">reMarkable tablet</a>) or there are more obscure options.</p><p>A device that is basically an e-ink version of an Android tablet has some Android related advantages (apps for stores like Kindle and Google Play Books) and disadvantages (will soon be out of date with a load of known Android security flaws - meaning using it for web browsing longterm would be ill advised once the device is known insecure).</p><p>In terms of price the Kobo Aura One (a 7.8 inch screen model) might be the best bet for spending as little over £100 as possible. Even secondhand spending £100 to £150 for an 8 inch e-reader seems the normal range and £200+ if buying new.</p><p>Ironically it looks like Kindle DX screens might be easier to buy as <a href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/inkplate-10-9-7-e-paper-display?variant=39959293591635">Inkplate displays</a> that are apparently <a href="https://inkplate.io/">recycled Kindle screens</a> than as working e-readers (unfortunately the 9.7 inch display alone is priced like an entire 8 inch e-reader - so if a consumer purchase it is a well-off tech hobbyist consumer purchase - not for an ordinary person looking for a finished working product).</p></main><footer> <small><a href="https://github.com/byjosh/jekyll-netlify-boilerplate-accessible-menu">This is a fork</a> (of <a href="https://github.com/danurbanowicz/jekyll-netlify-boilerplate" rel="noopener">Jekyll Netlify Boilerplate</a> that is maintained by <a href="https://www.danurbanowicz.com" rel="noopener">Dan Urbanowicz</a>).</small></footer><script> document.body.style.setProperty('--scroll', "0rem"); document.body.classList.add("with-js"); window.addEventListener('scroll', () => { var scrollamount = (window.pageYOffset / (window.innerHeight * 0.1)); var scroll = "0rem"; if (scrollamount > 0 && scrollamount < 1) { scroll = (scrollamount) + "rem"; } if (scrollamount > 1) { scroll = "1rem"; } document.body.style.setProperty('--scroll', scroll); }, false); </script></body></html>
