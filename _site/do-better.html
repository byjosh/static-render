But while that analysis may still be relevant - in that there are things people can do to do better - and not look fools; or worst: dishonest. This page talks about those things.</p><h2 id="lateral-reading---or-reading-about-your-sources-of-information">Lateral Reading - or reading about your sources of information</h2><p>In one sentence: open a new tab in a web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox etc.) and read about the website or author who is the source of your information - paying particular attention to sources that could get sued for falsehoods (such as: established newspapers &amp; identified journalists rather than random anonmyous bloggers).</p><emphasis>It is important to repeat this - Lateral Reading is a trainable technique - <strong>it is not a question of intelligence!</strong></emphasis><p>So if someone points something out to you that you could have found by a few minutes of Lateral Reading then it is not a proof of your failure but a proof of “Time on reconaissance is never wasted” (a military saying). I.e. training and using the technique will help avoid the avoidable surprises - like reconaissance does.</p><p>Easiest to illustrate Lateral Reading by example: in 2021 I got sent a version of <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/9/7/693">this paper by Walach et al</a> - the paper makes conclusions that are deeply &amp; demonstrably unsound regarding COVID-19 vaccinations - but without Lateral Reading it may be tough to spot them. By spending about 5 minutes searching I discovered the discussions of the key errors that make up <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/scientists-quit-journal-board-protesting-grossly-irresponsible-study-claiming-covid-19">this Science article about the reaction to the paper and its retraction</a>. The demonstrable error - <a href="https://web-archive-org.translate.goog/web/20210531183355/https://www.lareb.nl/pages/update-van-bijwerkingen?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=es&amp;_x_tr_hl=en-US&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp">which one can see in a translated version of the Dutch data source for deaths</a> is interpreting all deaths after vaccination as inflicted by the vaccine - when the data source specifically says that is not the case! The more subtle error is the paper touting a supposed conclusion from a study of 1.2 million Israelis that one needs to vaccinate 16 thousand people to prevent one death - Science article reported this as “a measure that is problematic, critics say, because as a vaccine succeeds, the number of people that must be vaccinated to prevent a death grows ever-larger.”. The value of Lateral Reading is that the paper was 8 pages and rather than closely reading 8 pages about 5 minutes of searching and listening to other sources gave verifiable information about the errors - and the fact that the paper was already retracted by the time I was sent it.</p><p>The term “Lateral Reading” is from <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3048994">this paper by Sam Wineburg and Sarah McGrew</a>. As one needs to keep repeating: Lateral Reading is a trainable technique and anyone’s initial failure to use it is not a sign of low intelligence. The page numbered 13 in the PDF of the paper shows this clearly with Figure 1. Figure 1 of the paper is about which professional association is judged more reliable by 3 groups - professional factcheckers, history faculty with PhDs, students (from Stanford). 100% of the factcheckers rated the professional association with 64 thousand members as more reliable than the fringe group, half the history faculty could not distinguish between them or judged the fringe professional association with less than a thousand members as more reliable, and only 20% of the students judged the main professional association as more reliable. And the factcheckers vastly outperformed both the other groups as they performed Lateral Reading as their way of analysing the sources.</p><p>To use Lateral Reading to efficiently &amp; reliably evaluate a source:</p><ol><li>Stop reading the source &amp; open a new tab.</li><li>Search for information about the source</li><li>Don’t just click the first link - refine the results if needed (this page on <a href="/better-search-engine-use">how to do more advanced searches</a> may help).</li><li>The goal is to read what others say about the source when those others are expert and/or identifiable - and because they are identifiable and at risk of being sued if uttering falsehoods they are likely to get basic facts straight.</li></ol><p>Regarding step 4: my example with the Walach paper brings up expert analysis and verifiable facts about the Walach paper (that it was misinterpeting the data source). On pages numbered 24 &amp; 25 of the Lateral Reading paper it comments on how a New York Times journalist visiting the address of the Employment Policies Institute sees no evidence of an actual office - just PR firm staff. So the conclusion that the Employment Policies Institute is a public relations front is supported by a specifc factual claim about the office - in a publication like the New York Times that would run the risk of being sued for defamation if it published something false and damaging (such as claiming a firm is a front when it is not). So step 3 and 4 is aimed at getting information from sites with a known reputation for checking the facts - who are accountable to the courts if they fail badly.</p><h2 id="the-illusion-of-communication---loopingmirroring-and-what-do-you-mean-by-that">The illusion of communication - looping/mirroring and “What do you mean by that?”</h2><p>There is an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2002/oct/23/comment.guardiansocietysupplement">Irish epigram</a> “I know that you believe you understand what you think I said, but I’m not sure you realise that what you heard is not what I meant.” - which sums up the illusion of communication. People thinking they understand what the other person has said - when they have not.</p><p>There are two practices that can help here.</p><ol><li>Looping a.k.a. mirroring - after someone has said something that you want to ensure you understand repeat in your own words a summary of the speaker’s point back to the speakers and ask them if you have got it right. This is called looping by <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/05/01/conflict-resolution-politics-amanda-ripley-excerpt-484786">Gary Friedman, a mediation pioneer</a> and mirroring in the <a href="https://www.cnvc.org/learn-nvc/the-nvc-model">Nonviolent Communication approach</a>. This is more likely useful when every point needs confirmation or when you are confident of most points but need the outcome confirming.</li><li>“What do you mean by that?” - asked as a follow-up question about a point is maybe more likely to help when you sense uncertainty - or someone making a suspect point - and asking them to elaborate will give you a better sense of what you need to confirm by looping/mirroring. It may be particularly useful if someone is making a dodgy remark - by having the remark maker reflect until they are uncomfortable enough to apologise or retract it (when all the while you are “just asking questions”).</li></ol><p>And while perceptiveness might be generally related to intelligence I would not relate the absence of doing mirroring/looping to an absence of intelligence as such. It takes 2 people to mirror/loop. And the Irish epigram speaks to the seductiveness of thinking we have understood the other person - even when we have not.</p><p>If one senses a conflict and can take the time then asking “What do you mean by that?” or similar information gathering questions and then using mirroring/looping to understand the other person’s position - as much as they will reveal it - may help things to come to an outcome that is at least thorough and clear.</p><p>Clearly understood positions may be irreconcilable - but at least the conflict is not based on a misunderstanding - or unresolved through an avoidable lack of clarity or lack of explanation.</p><h2 id="abortion-is-essential-healthcare">Abortion is essential healthcare</h2><p>I did Human Biology as one of my A-Levels and Physiology as part of my degree. Those courses tend to concentrate on the common or healthy development for the most part. So while I was aware from that that early loss of pregnancy is in fact quite common <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3393170/">- this reference putting it at 31% of pregnancies (about two thirds before they were detected by the pregnant woman) -</a> - I came out with ideas on abortion shaped more by the <a href="https://www.acog.org/womens-health/infographics/effectiveness-of-birth-control-methods">inevitable less than 100% effectiveness of reversible contraception</a> and the consequent necessity of abortion as a means of retaining control of one’s life in this context - but that loss of control is not perhaps the cruelest effect of removing restricting abortion. Perhaps more cruel is when it is essential healthcare - and managing miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies falls under that category. Page 33 of the <a href="https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/news/nimtreport50278.pdf">report into the death of Savita Halappanavar</a> has her and her husband receiving the news that a miscarriage is inevitable - but her request for termination in a situation where it was known that miscarriage was the inevitable outcome was denied based on then current Irish restrictions on abortion. She died from utterly preventable complications.</p><p>To quote Renee Bracey Sherman’s <a href="https://www.congress.gov/117/meeting/house/114995/documents/HHRG-117-IF02-Transcript-20220719.pdf">US Congressional testimony to the House of Representatives Energy &amp; Commerce Committee</a>:</p><div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>"I want them to know that there are safe methods to self-managing 
their abortions according to the World Health Organization.
It is one mifepristone pill followed by four misoprostol pills 
dissolved under the tongues 24 to 48 hours later or a series of 
12 misoprostol pills, four at a time, dissolved under the tongue
every three hours."
</code></pre></div></div><p>and this means the coat hangers and abortions have not the association they had in 1950s America or England. So early abortions are safely self-manageable in most cases if one obtains the right pills.</p><p>But this does not help when an abortion is needed for healthcare reasons in a hospital setting. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jan/26/poland-death-of-woman-refused-abortion">Multiple</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/06/poles-march-against-abortion-ban-after-pregnant-womans-death">women</a> have died in Poland as a result of the law restricting abortion - even though on paper it allows as a valid reason for abortion the endangerment of the life or health of the mother.</p><p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ectopic-pregnancy/symptoms-causes/syc-20372088">Ectopic pregnancy (outside the uterus - such as in a fallopian tube)</a> is an inevitable occurence in any large population - and can cause life threatening internal bleeding if not treated promptly - and the treatment is classed as an abortion.</p><p>So if you did not quite appreciate the role of abortion as essential, life-saving, healthcare then maybe your education had issues - like mine. But it is essential healthcare. And what should be the primary question is the pregnant person asking if they want to be pregnant and decisions going there - to not place that first is a horrifically sexist forced birth agenda; one which causes foreseeable and cruel deaths.</p></main><footer> <small><a href="https://github.com/byjosh/jekyll-netlify-boilerplate-accessible-menu">This is a fork</a> (of <a href="https://github.com/danurbanowicz/jekyll-netlify-boilerplate" rel="noopener">Jekyll Netlify Boilerplate</a> that is maintained by <a href="https://www.danurbanowicz.com" rel="noopener">Dan Urbanowicz</a>).</small></footer><script> document.body.style.setProperty('--scroll', "0rem"); document.body.classList.add("with-js"); window.addEventListener('scroll', () => { var scrollamount = (window.pageYOffset / (window.innerHeight * 0.1)); var scroll = "0rem"; if (scrollamount > 0 && scrollamount < 1) { scroll = (scrollamount) + "rem"; } if (scrollamount > 1) { scroll = "1rem"; } document.body.style.setProperty('--scroll', scroll); }, false); </script></body></html>
